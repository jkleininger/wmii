Your battery may be called something different, so check /proc/acpi for its name. Also, change 89000 to whatever the capacity is for your battery. This returns the remaining battery power as a percentage.

    $(echo $(awk '/rem/ { print $3/89000 }' /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state| hoc| cut -c3,4)%

hoc comes from plan9port or 9base.

    $(free -m |awk '/cache:/ { print $3"M" }')

$(awk '{ print $2 }' /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM0/temperature)C
